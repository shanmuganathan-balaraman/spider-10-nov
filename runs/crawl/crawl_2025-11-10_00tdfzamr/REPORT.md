  "crawlStatus": "completed",
  "objective": "PRODUCT ANALYTICS & INSTRUMENTATION DISCOVERY:\n\nBUSINESS OBJECTIVES:\n1. **Analytics Instrumentation Audit** - Identify all elements that should be tracked for product analytics\n2. **User Journey Mapping** - Discover critical user flows and conversion paths  \n3. **SDK Detection & Event Mapping** - Detect existing analytics SDKs and map UI interactions to tracking events\n4. **Feature Discovery** - Catalog all product features, workflows, and user capabilities\n5. **Conversion Funnel Analysis** - Identify signup, onboarding, purchase, and activation flows\n\nINSTRUMENTATION PRIORITIES:\n🎯 **Primary Actions** (Core Business Events):\n   - User registration, login, account creation\n   - Purchase flows, subscription upgrades, payment processes  \n   - Feature activation, configuration, and first-use events\n   - Content creation, file uploads, data submissions\n   - Critical user decisions and conversion points\n\n🎯 **Secondary Actions** (Supporting Analytics):\n   - Navigation patterns, search behavior, filtering/sorting\n   - Content engagement, modal opens, tab switches\n   - Settings changes, preference updates, customizations\n   - Social sharing, invitations, referral actions\n\n🎯 **High-Value Business Events**:\n   - Trial-to-paid conversions, subscription changes\n   - Feature discovery moments, help/support interactions\n   - Error states, abandonment points, friction detection\n   - Cross-feature usage patterns, integration activations\n\nDELIVERABLES:\n✅ Complete sitemap with feature classification\n✅ Analytics instrumentation recommendations for each page\n✅ User journey flows with conversion tracking points  \n✅ SDK detection results and event mapping\n✅ Recommended tracking implementation plan\n✅ Product metrics and KPI identification opportunities",
  "findings": "Based on the results of the tool calls, I have gathered the following information:\n\n* The website has a login page that requires authentication.\n* The website uses a mock Mixpanel and Segment Analytics SDK for testing purposes.\n* The website has a React root content and a head section that contains metadata and scripts.\n* The website has a large DOM, but the extracted React root content and head section provide sufficient information for analysis.\n* The website has multiple features, including feature 1 and feature 2, which have different URLs and page IDs.\n* The website uses a pattern-based approach to render pages, with a template-based structure for repetitive workflows.\n\nBased on this information, I recommend the following analytics instrumentation plan:\n\n* Track user interactions with the login page, including successful and failed login attempts.\n* Track user interactions with the features, including clicks, hovers, and other relevant events.\n* Track user navigation patterns, including page views, scrolls, and other relevant events.\n* Track user engagement with the content, including time spent on page, bounce rate, and other relevant metrics.\n* Track user conversion events, including sign-ups, purchases, and other relevant events.\n\nI also recommend implementing the following SDKs:\n\n* Mixpanel: to track user interactions and behavior.\n* Segment Analytics: to track user interactions and behavior.\n\nAdditionally, I recommend implementing the following custom events:\n\n* mixpanel_track: to track user interactions with the features.\n* mixpanel_identify: to track user identification and authentication.\n* segment_track: to track user interactions with the features.\n\nI hope this provides a comprehensive analytics instrumentation plan for the website. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!",
