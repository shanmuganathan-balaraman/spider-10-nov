The pages follow a similar pattern, with a product description, price, and add-to-cart button.\n2. **Categories**: This feature has a list of category pages, each with a unique URL. The pages follow a similar pattern, with a list of products belonging to that category.\n\nThe website also has interactive elements such as:\n\n1. **Search**: A search bar is present on the main page, allowing users to search for products.\n2. **Forms**: There are forms present on the website, but they are not functional due to the constraint of not submitting forms.\n\nThe website has a simple architecture, with each feature having a unique URL. The pages within each feature follow a similar pattern, making it easy to catalog them using the `detect_page_pattern` tool.\n\n**Cross-feature relationships and internal linking patterns:**\n\nThe website has internal linking between the main features/sections. For example, the products page has links to the categories page, and the categories page has links to the products page.\n\n**User journeys:**\n\nThe website allows users to navigate between the main features/sections using the global navigation structure. Users can search for products using the search bar, and view product details on the product pages. Users can also view products by category on the category pages.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\nThe crawl was limited by the constraints of not submitting forms and not performing destructive actions. This limited the ability to fully explore the website's functionality, but still allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the website's architecture and user journeys.",
